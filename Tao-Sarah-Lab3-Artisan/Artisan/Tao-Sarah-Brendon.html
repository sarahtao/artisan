			<h2>Biography</h2>
				<p>
				Brendon Urie is a lead vocalist and one of the founders of Panic! at the Disco, an American pop rock band started in 2004 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Along with his childhood friends, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, and Brent Wilson, they recorded their first demos in high school and became popular after vwriting their lead single, "I Write Sins Not Tragedies" album. Through a series of events with band members joining and leaving the team, Brendon Urie became the last man standing in 2015.

				<p>
				Brendon Urie was born in <em>April 12, 1987</em> in <strong>St. George, Utah</strong>. He was the fifth and youngest child, and raised in a Mormon family. In high school, he would work at Tropical Smoothie Cafe in order to pay his band's rent for their practice space. At work, Urie often sang for customers, and was often asked to sing from customers for a tip. He married his wife, Sarah Orzechowski in 2013.

				<p>
				Now as a solo artist in the band, Brendon takes part not only as a lead vocalist, but also as the guitarist, keyboardist, bassist, and drumist. His musical style originally stemmed from the music his parents listened to such as Beach Boys, the Kink, or the Beatles. However, the music he creates now leans more toward classic or pop rock.
